# Link to the address that I used to "call contract with token" in Axelar Testnet

NOTE: this is my main testnet address but no my learnweb3 address. I didn't used my learnweb3 address because that's my personal address too; and as Haardik have teached us: you never should use your personal address if you are going to upload your work in a public repository.
